Euclid: A Fully In-Network, P4-based Approach for Real-Time DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation

This is the main code repository of the mechanism we proposed within the draft paper "Euclid: A Fully In-Network, P4-based Approach for Real-Time DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation" (submitted to IEEE TNSM; currently under review).

The Euclid source code is currently available at [ddosm-p4](https://github.com/asilha/ddosm-p4).

**This repository is a work in progress.**
