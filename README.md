# EUCLID

This is the central code repository of the in-network DDoS attack detection and mitigation mechanism we proposed in the journal article "Euclid: A Fully In-Network, P4-based Approach for Real-Time DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation" (in _IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management_,
[DOI: 10.1109/TNSM.2020.3048265](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2020.3048265)).

The Euclid source code is currently available at [ddosm-p4](https://github.com/asilha/ddosm-p4).
